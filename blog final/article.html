      <h1>Right livelihood</h1>
      <p>from Buddha teachings</p>
      <p id="firstRow">
        Right livelihood <em>(samyag-ājīva / sammā-ājīva) </em>precept is mentioned in many early Buddhist texts, such
        as the
        Mahācattārīsaka Sutta in Majjhima Nikaya as follows:<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        "And what is right livelihood? Right livelihood, I tell you, is of two sorts: There is right livelihood with
        effluents, siding with merit, resulting in acquisitions; there is right livelihood that is noble, without
        effluents, transcendent, a factor of the path.
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "And what is the right livelihood with effluents, siding with merit, resulting in acquisitions? There is the
            case where a disciple of the noble ones abandons wrong livelihood and maintains his life with right
            livelihood.
            This is the right livelihood with effluents, siding with merit, resulting in acquisitions.
          </p>
          <p>
            "And what is the right livelihood that is noble, without effluents, transcendent, a factor of the path? The
            abstaining, desisting, abstinence, avoidance of wrong livelihood in one developing the noble path whose mind
            is
            noble, whose mind is without effluents, who is fully possessed of the noble path. (...)
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>
        The early canonical texts state right livelihood as avoiding and abstaining from wrong livelihood. This virtue
        is further explained in Buddhist texts, states Vetter, as "living from begging, but not accepting everything and
        not possessing more than is strictly necessary".[87] For lay Buddhists, states Harvey, this precept requires
        that
        the livelihood avoid causing suffering to sentient beings by cheating them, or harming or killing them in any
        way.
      </p>
      <h1>Right effort</h1>
      <p>from Buddha teachings</p>
      <p id="firstRow">Right effort <em>(samyag-vyāyāma / sammā-vāyāma) </em>is preventing the arising of unwholesome
        states, and the
        generation of wholesome states. This includes indriya-samvara, "guarding the sense-doors," restraint of the
        sense faculties. Right effort is presented in the Pali Canon, such as the Sacca-vibhanga Sutta, as
        follows:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>And what is right effort?</p>
        <p>Here the monk arouses his will, puts forth effort, generates energy, exerts his mind, and strives to prevent
          the arising of evil and unwholesome mental states that have not yet arisen.<br>
          He arouses his will... and strives to eliminate evil and unwholesome mental states that have already
          arisen.<br>
          He arouses his will... and strives to generate wholesome mental states that have not yet arisen.<br>
          He arouses his will, puts forth effort, generates energy, exerts his mind, and strives to maintain wholesome
          mental states that have already arisen, to keep them free of delusion, to develop, increase, cultivate, and
          perfect them.</p>
        <p>This is called right effort.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The unwholesome states (akusala) are described in the Buddhist texts, as those relating to thoughts, emotions,
        intentions, and these include pancanivarana (five hindrances) – sensual thoughts, doubts about the path,
        restlessness, drowsiness, and ill will of any kind. Of these, the Buddhist traditions consider sensual
        thoughts and ill will needing more right effort. Sensual desire that must be eliminated by effort includes
        anything related to sights, sounds, smells, tastes and touch. This is to be done by restraint of the sense
        faculties (indriya-samvara). Ill will that must be eliminated by effort includes any form of aversion including
        hatred, anger, resentment towards anything or anyone.

        <p id="firstRow"> Gautama Buddha was a contemporary of Mahavira. Gautama Buddha’s royal name was Siddhartha. He
          was the son of
          Suddhodhana, the Chief of Sakya clan of Kapilvastu in the Nepal Tarai area. He was born in 566 B.C. in the
          village of Lumbini a few miles from Kapilvastu.</p>
        <p>At the age of 29 he was blessed with a son but he did not feel happy, instead he considered it as a bond.
          Soon after the birth of his son he left his home in search of truth and be­came a wandering ascetic. This
          renunciation by Buddha is known as Maha Parityaga.</p>
        <p>He remained in meditation for seven days and seven nights and was ultimately enlightened on the eighth day.
          On the day of enlightenment he came to be known as Buddha or Tathagat. Siddhartha discovered the Law of
          Causation, a cycle of twelve causes and effects condi­tioning the universe. This Law had not been thought of
          by any philosopher before him.</p>
